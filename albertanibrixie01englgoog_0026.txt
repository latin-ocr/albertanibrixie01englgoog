than his additions, which appear to have in part been bor· ¹
rowed from the treatise of Albertano De Amore et Dile-
ctione Ilei¹. Jean de Meung has generally abridged, now
and then in an unsparing manner3 but as he has upon the
whole followed his original, this will, even by a direct
comparison, be of no little use to those who study the
Tale of Melite. As for the literal translations, it isso
evident that the Latin text offers an excellent means of '
explaining, controlling and correcting them, that Ι need not ἵ
enter into any demonstration of it; so much the more, as
Ι have on an earlier occasion endeavoured to show that
such a collation, when possible, ought not to be neglected,
and that accordingly editors of old texts should, for that
purpose, always do their best to lind out the latin origi-
nals from which they have‘so often been derived. ,
Also in another respect does the Liber Consolationis
et Consilii prove important for the study of the middle-
agcs. It is a curious fact that mediaeval moralists, as
Gautier de Lille in his Moralium Dopmo, frequently com-
posed their manuals almost exclusively from sayings of the
ancients⁹. Albertano has not done so; he very often
quotes the Bible and Christian writers3 yet his treatise
contains a considerable number of passages horrowed from ¹
ancient philosophans, Generally he names his author, but l
often he does not, or, if he does, he substitutas one name
for another. Evcn before the Chaucer Society, in Oc-
tober 1871, gave the impulse to this edition, Ihadbegun to
verify his references and trace his sources, and have ever
since spent a great deal of time and labour in these researohes,
which may indeed sometimes offer an interest similar to
that of a hunter tracking his gamo, but are upon the
whole far from amusing. Yet Ι believe this is the only

² The same thing may be said of many chapters in the fourth book of
