it is no little praise that he could do thus muoh''. This
’ judgment hasbeen repeated, almost word lor word, by
Nannucci, but rejected by Paulin Paris, who supposes Ti-
raboschi had not even read :libertano's Book of Consola-
tion and Cauasel, which looking not at its bulk, but its
literary merit, is his principal work¹. Albertano is so
far fr·on1.deserving any reproaoh l'or want ol method, that
on the contrary he is perhaps rather too methodical,
too exact in enumerating all sorte ol cases, too exube-

if Albertano had not slrared the taste theu prevailiug, and
instead ol' quoting a great many authors had used his
own worda, his Book ot' Consolation would have lost as'

One circumstance that has certainly contributed very
much to the popularity of this treatise, is the form ol talc
