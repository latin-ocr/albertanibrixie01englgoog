of them we learn that he lived, at the end of 1243, at
Genove, whither he had probably acconipauied his coun-
tryman Emanuele Maggi, who' had been elected pedestri of ’
that city. According to custom the foreign podestd, gene·
rally elected for three years, took with him -his judges
end notarios. Among the judges of Emauuele Maggi was,
no doubt, Albertano, when he made before the judges and

notaries ol Geoova his speech Super ‹eorofirmotione viiio ’

1111111111. The other four orations were apparently ad-
dressed to the Brescian judges or lawyers and the Fran-
ciscan friars, when they were “as usual' assembled at

Midlent in the monastery of that order, for the purpose of ¹

feediug the poor. They are composed quite in the same
manner as Albertano's other writiugs, in an edifying and ·
religious rather than academical strain, and might very
well be called sermons. So we have no reason whatever
to adopt the name oi Academy, bestowed upon those as-
semblies by Federico Odorici. Three oi' these speeches are
without date, whereas the last is said to have been made

iu the year 12502. A trectisc De Epistolori Dictamioa
