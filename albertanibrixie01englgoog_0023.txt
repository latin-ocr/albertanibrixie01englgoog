, His wife, Prudentia, on the other hand, is painted as a

strong and noble-minded but kindhearted and religious
woman, far superior to her husband in knowledge and in· ’
telligence, though not unaoquaiuted with those small and
harmless, or at least well-meant artifices and stratagems
that are so characteristic of her sex. Unhappily, Alber·
tano has identified her with himself to such a degree, that
she not only quotes all sorta of authors even Alberteno
himself, but reasons in juridioal matters like an accom-
plished lawyer, equally versed in the Digest and the Decre-
tals. Indead if we did not remember her allegorical dig-
’ nity, we might be tempted to use a modern term and eall
her a most terrible blaa-stockiug. Yet with this restric-
tion Albertano shows himself in the narrative part of his
book upon the whole a tolerably skilful painter, not only
of characters but also of soenes, as may be seen in his
description of the tumultuary oouucil (p. 6-11y

· The dialogue. parts of the book, like the other writings
of Albertauo, are interwoven with very copious quota· .
tione, and so far not original; yet his personal opinion does
not disappear in this throng of sentences3 aud, at all eveutS,
the system is his own. He is not free from digressions;

he cannot withstand the temptation of a by the bpe, for ·

example in the chapters VI—X 3 but heunotwithstandiug sa-
fely leads his reader to the goal he had proposed: 'cou-
demnation of feuds and wilful wars, and submission to law. ’
This is the principal tendenoy of his book, and very re-
markable for the time when it was written; but it has
another¹ aim, not less remarkable though perhaps less ob·
vious. The superiority of Prudentia is not only due
to her representing Wisdom itself: Albertano has certainly
meant to glorify in her person Woman in general. Yet he

did not, of course, dream of suoh a thing as Woman's '

Emancipation and bas accordingly represented her as the
loving wife of Melibeus, submissive and obedient to, her

husband, at least in form, though by far his better in
illoerran. Lib· Censor. Β
