VI INTRODUOTION.

we 000 draw any information on the life of Albertano are,
besides a few historical documents in which he is men-
tioned, the scanty notices contained in the introductione
and explicito of his writings¹. There he always calls him·
· 0011 causidicus Bririensir de oru Sanctae Apuliae or carrei-
' dicus de Sancto Aputha, which, however, does notimply‚
θ that he was born at Brescia, or especially in the quarter
of S. Agatha, but only that he was a judge at Brescia, and
lived therei. At all events he was a citizen of that com-
’ munity; and, as Jacopo Malvezzi and others speak of bis
family and himself as of Brescians, we have no reason
to doubt that this town was his birth-place.

The year of Albertano's birth is not known; yet, by
inferentes drawn from the data afiorded by his writings,
it will be possible to corne to anapproximative determina·
tion. From the dedication af his Liber Gorrsololionis 01
Consilii, written in the year 1246, we learn that his son
Giovanni at that time not only studied 'the chirurgical art,

but must have begun to practise it; ¹he cannot therefore
have been less than about twenty years old. As Albertano
evidently in the same, manner dedicated his book De Arta

’ Brixiensis. Per haec tempora [1235] Albertanus de Albertanis iurisperitus
lels egreglus in bac civitate habebatur, vir precipuus, sapientia plenus.
llic-multa Moralium dogmata ad utilitatem suorum Oisium ceterorumque
logentium quosdam libros componens mirabiliter scripsit”.
