XVIII INTRODUG'I'ION.

almost every respect¹. if Albertauo had not consecrated
achapter (ch. V) to the praise of woman, we might be
uncertain as to his intentiou3 but as it is uo room is left
for doubt. We cannot enter into any further aualysis; we
have said enough to show that the Book of consolation,
though largely woven from the sayings of different authors
⁵ by no means deserves the namo ofa rnere patchwork.
liber Consolationis ct donsiiii, as mentioned above p.
XII, has been printed in Latin and iu ltaliau together with
¹the other treatises of Albertano. Separately it has been
translated into French, German, Dutch, and perhaps into
other languages. The French translation is not known to
have been published, whereas both the Dutch translation
(which isin verse) aud the German have been printed, the
latter even in iive editions⁹. Besides the literal French
transfer there existe another French version, or rather
adaptation, Le livre de Meilibe'e et Pandence by Jean de
Meungl. This adaptation, from which Geoffrey ¹Chaucer
has taken his Tale os Maliba, has been printed several
times: separately at the eud ol the ΧΨ11 century, in 1504
together with the French translation ol the Solotinnr Ludi
Ι Scoclrornm by ,Jacques de Cessoles, and in the edition of
Le Me‘ncpr‘er rie Parte, the author of which has ernbodied
