more particularly his scope in the Book of Consolatiou.
There can be no doubt that this form has rendered it more
attractiva to its readers. And yet the tale is partly al-
legorized by Albertauo himself (see p. 201. p. 84), and
Prudentia, if not Meliheus, must at least in parthe
considered as an allegorica} personage. As Albertano's Book
Ι01 Consolatiou and Counsel, looking at its title and the
dialogus, has some resemblance to the book of Boethius on
the Consolation of Philosophy, his Prudentia is not without
a certain analogy to the Philosophia 01 Boethius¹. But
it is from apassage of Cassiodorus, quoted by Albertauo
(p. 20), that he has taken the name of his heroine, if we
may call her so, and the general idea of her character:
Superuvit cuncto infatigabilis ct repedita prudentia. The
name of Melibeus, the outline 01 010 person, and the
first sketch of the whole narrative, he found in this distich,
which he (p. 53) wrongly ascribes to Μο11101101Ξ

Consilio juvenum fidis, Melibee; ruinam
, Expectare polea, dum sine consilio ea.

Albertano derives the name of his hero from· mel and bi-
0000 (p. 83), and describes him as an honest but rash and
hotbrained young man of high rank,⁸ indulging himself in
the pleasures 01 1110 and confiding 100 much in his riches.

like Boethius, wrote his Book of Consolation during his imprisonment.
