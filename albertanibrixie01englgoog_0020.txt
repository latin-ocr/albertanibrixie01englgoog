ascribed to Albertano by· Huillard-Brdholles, is mentioned
by nobody else¹.' Whether Albertano is really the author

’ of this plece, is a question we must leave undetermined.

, Not so the assertiou of Crescimbeni, repeated by Quadrio,
that certain manuscripts of ailbertano's vorks should cou-
tain poema t'rom his hand, which has been. proved to be
,decidedly false⁹.

Resumiug the preceding notices on the life of Albertano,
we find that it presents two distinct periodo, one of active
participation in public affairs, until 1238, the other of lite-
rary productim, from 1238 until 1250. That his occupa-
tious during the latter years¹ were owing to ,his with-
drawing from public lire', ve may gness, though not essert,
'from some words (below p. 65-66) in which he blames
Ι those decisicns in state affairs that “follow the pleasure of
the multitude, and not the visdom ol' the few’'. ὈΥ his
life aiter 1250, when he was about 58 years old, we know
nothing3 nor do ve know when he died. Fed. Odorici

tells us indeed, referring to Mazzuchelli‚ yet without saying
where, that he died about 1270; but this is certainlya
mere supposition. .

Tirabosohi has passed a very harsh judgment ou the
writings of Albertano. “From this author'’, he says, “we
must not expect method in treating his subject, nor force
of reasoning nor precision of ideas. He almost contenta
himself with j0ining together passages from the Scrip-
, ture, and from many sacred aud profane authors, on
the matter he discusses3 and at the time when he lived

mini'. These sermones do not appear tc have been ever printed. The

editions mentioned by F. Odorici (p. 359, n. l) are, l suppose, editions
of the Troct. de Arte Loquendi.
