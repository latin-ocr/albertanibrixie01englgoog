their way through 111, Now the treatise De Amore et
Dilectione Del, dedicated to the eldest son, Vincenzio,
was written in the year 12383 and, 11 the eldest son was
at that time about twenty years old, it is likely that Al-
, bertano had married in 1217. Should we suppose him to
have wedded at the age of twenty-four or twenty-five years·
we may conclude that he was born in 1193 0r1192. At
